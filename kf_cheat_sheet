Quick Kalman filtering cheat sheet:

Dimensions:
    n : dimension of state vector
    m : dimension of measurement vector
    k : dimension of control vector

Equations:
Prediction:
    x = Ax + Bu
    P = APA^(T) + Q
Calculation:
    K = PH^(T) * (HPH^(T) + R)^(-1)
Estimation:
    x = x + K(z - Hx)
    P = (I - KH)P

Note that subscripts are not available in this format.
